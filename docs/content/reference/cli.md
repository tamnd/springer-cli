```
spr <command> [flags]
```

Run `spr <command> --help` for the full flag list on any command, and see [configuration](/reference/configuration/) for the flags every command shares.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `get` | Fetch one url and report how it was classified |
| `cache` | Show or clear the page cache |
| `version` | Print the version, commit and build date |

## `spr get`

```
spr get <url or path> [flags]
```

The client with nothing on top of it. Follows the redirect chain, counts the hops, classifies the response on its content, and prints what it found without parsing a single field. Use it when a later command says something surprising and the question is whether the page or the parser changed.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--body` | Write the response body to stdout instead of the summary |
| `--kind` | Kind expected: `any`, `html`, `pdf` or `xml`. Deciding this up front is what makes `wrong_kind` possible. |

```bash
spr get /article/10.1007/s10994-021-05946-3
spr get --body /journal/10994 > journal.html
spr get -o json '/search.rss?query=uncertainty'
```

A bare path is resolved against `https://link.springer.com`. A full url is fetched as given, including urls on other hosts.

## `spr cache`

```
spr cache [--clear]
```

Prints the cache directory, how many responses are in it, how much room they take, and the time to live. `--clear` empties it.

## `spr version`

Prints the version, commit and build date stamped in at link time, plus the Go version, the platform, the user agent this build sends, and the pace settings it will hold to.
